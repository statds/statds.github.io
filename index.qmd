Hello there, I'm Lucas, a Ph.D. candidate studying Statistics at the UConn
Department. My research interests primarily revolve around statistical
computing, Bayesian inference, spatial statistics, and exploring innovative
applications of statistical methodologies. Apart from that, I enjoy learning
about programming languages and emerging technologies.

If you browse through this website, you'll find some of my blog posts, mainly
discussing R or statistical concepts, as well as my CV, publications, and
ongoing projects.
